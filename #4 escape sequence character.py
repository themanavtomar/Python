# Escape sequences are preceded by a backslash ('\') and serve as a signal to the Python interpreter that a special character or action is intended.
# Here are some common escape sequences in Python:
# \n - newline
print("This is the first line.\nThis is the second line.")
# \t - tab
print("This is the first line.\tThis is the second line.")
# \r - carriage return
print("This is the first carriage return line.\tThis is the second carriage return line.")

# \b - backspace
print("This is the first backspace line.\tThis is the second backspace line.")

# \f - form feed
print("This is the first form feed line.\tThis is the second form feed line.")

# \v - vertical tab
print("This is the frist vertical line.\vThis is the second vertical line.")
# \' - single quote
# Escape a single quote character
print('This is a string with a single quote\' in it.')
# \" - double quote
print("This is a string with a double quote\" in it\".")
# \\ - backslash
print("This is the first line.\\This is the second line.")
# Escape sequences are useful for a variety of purposes, such as:
# Inserting characters that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to type directly, such as a newline character or a tab character.
# Escaping characters that have special meaning in Python, such as the single quote character or the double quote character.
# Creating multi-line strings.




# Escape a double quote character


# Create a multi-line string
print("""This is a multi-line string.
It can span multiple lines.""")
s = 'Hey, what\'s up?'
print(s)
